# homelab

Welcome to my homelab configuration repository! This repo contains the manifests, configurations, and resources I use to run a self-hosted Kubernetes environment at home.

## Overview

* **Cluster Type:** Kubernetes (kubeadm)
* **Nodes:** 3 Proxmox virtual machines
* **Purpose:** Self-hosted services and experimentation with GitOps

I use Flux to manage my cluster declaratively, syncing manifests directly from this repository. Everything is open and public, so feel free to browse, learn, or adapt ideas for your own homelab setup.
